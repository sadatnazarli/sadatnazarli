# Hi, I'm Sadat Nazarli 👋

### **Software Engineer & Business Administration Student**
*Bridging the gap between technical systems and business logic.*

I am a **Solo Software Developer** focused on building high-performance backend systems, automation, and AI-integrated applications. Currently pursuing my degree in **Business Administration at TED University**, I bring a strategic, product-oriented mindset to every line of code I write.

## 📚 Beyond the Code
When I'm not in the terminal, I am deeply engaged with classic literature and philosophy. I find that the logic of programming and the inquiry of existentialism often go hand-in-hand.
